How to use CPU rtos template:
CPU rtos template/src has currently 3 files.
main.c
temp_thread.h
temp_thread.c

Temp_thread.c is an example/ guide for your RTOS threads.

When you create a new thread make first a .h file with this naming convention <your thread name>_thread.h
Then a .c file following the same convention.
